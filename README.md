# TomTom Waypoints Pin
WoW addon for 3.3.5a that creates TomTom waypoints by pressing Alt + Right Click on the map.

It also tries to have a useful label for the waypoints.

Note: TomTom does that natively by pressing Ctrl + Right Click. I prefer Alt + Right Click and a better waypoint name. That's why this addon exists.
